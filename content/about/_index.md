### Our principles

- Everyone should feel welcome, safe and comfortable to give talks, workshops, share
  ideas and engage in open discussion without the threat of intimidation or public 
  humiliation.

- Be respectful and excellent to each other, we do not tolerate any type of 
  harassment to speakers, attendants or organizers.

- All topics related to testing are welcome.

- Every talk, presentation, and workshop should have as one of its goals to
  transmit a valuable message to the community (e.g. good practices, lessons 
  learned, new tools or innovative use of existing ones, etc).
