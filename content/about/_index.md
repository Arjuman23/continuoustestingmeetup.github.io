The Continuous Testing Meetup is a community for testers, developers,
and anyone who wants to share their ideas and learn from peers. 

Join us if you are interested in Continuous Testing, Agile Testing, Selenium, Appium,
WebDriver, Espresso, XCUITest, Testing & Automation, and any other related tools and
techniques.

We bring people together to discuss not only technology but also all the skills
that are required to succeed in today's testing industry.

### Our principles

- Everyone should feel welcome, safe and comfortable to give talks, workshops, share
  ideas and engage in open discussion without the threat of intimidation or public 
  humiliation.

- Be respectful and excellent to each other, we do not tolerate any type of 
  harassment to speakers, attendants or organizers.

- All topics related to testing are welcome.

- Every talk, presentation, and workshop should have as one of its goals to
  transmit a valuable message to the community (e.g. good practices, lessons 
  learned, new tools or innovative use of existing ones, etc).
