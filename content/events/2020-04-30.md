### Level Up the Developer Experience using Tests
[Eli Flores, Software Engineer at Sauce Labs](https://www.linkedin.com/in/elifloresch/)

What is complicated for the Development Team, is more complicated for 
the Customer. Could Automated Tests guide us to the light side and help 
us improve the Developer Experience and result in making the journey of 
our customers through our product more delightful?
We will go into a little journey of Automated Testing, with a focus 
on End to End Testing.
