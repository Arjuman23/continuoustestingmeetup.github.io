### Modern PERFORMANCE testing principles: _Identify old and obsolete performance testing practices to embrace the new ways_

[Leandro Melendez, Performance Testing Manager at QualiTest group](https://www.linkedin.com/in/leandromelendez)

In this talk, Leandro will describe a bit of the performance testing history and show 
how it ended on the common malpractices that many follow in this trade. Especially 
nowadays on these agile days that do not allow those old ways. We will see fun examples 
of those DON'Ts with an explanation of why those are not good approaches. And of course, 
a set of the DO's for these modern Agile and continuous days with quick and fun examples 
as well. You will get a blast full of learning and cool examples.

The presentation is addressed at everyone involved in the software development 
business, at any of its stages. Especially to testers and the ones interested in already 
deep in the performance testing world. But leaving some space for anyone from the 
management tier of things that wish to understand better which ones are the best 
practices and how to leverage them in these modern agile days.

The audience will get a better understanding of the reasons for certain practices 
and the reasons to avoid old ones that are still lurking bog time in many organizations.
