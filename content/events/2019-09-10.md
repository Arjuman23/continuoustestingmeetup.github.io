### End-to-end load testing at scale
[Oliwia Zaremba, Software Engineer at Zalando SE](https://twitter.com/tortilato)

Zalando served over 4,200 orders per minute at the peak of Black 
Friday 2018 campaign. In the world of microservices, Kubernetes, 
autoscaling and ubiquitous monitoring, load testing still played 
a crucial role to ensure the readiness of all the systems without 
overprovisioning and wasting money. I will share the challenges 
we met during our journey and the lessons learned from the process 
of simulating real usersâ€™ behavior on Zalando website at a large scale.

### Simplifying Test Automation with OxygenHQ

Test automation has been around for almost two decades yet for many 
years the market was questioning its efficiency and ROI. However, 
since Selenium framework has been released, test automation has been 
seeing a renaissance. What started as a developer-oriented tool has 
now become a de-facto standard for web and mobile automation testing, 
and yet many QA teams still struggle to implement Selenium in a timely 
and cost efficient manner. We've got some help coming your way!

Nachum will present Oxygen, a new open source framework and IDE for 
Selenium. Oxygen significantly simplifies work with Selenium and Appium 
by providing a unique combination of Node.js-based framework and a 
dedicated development environment. With Oxygen, both manual testers 
and test automation engineers can easily create a wide range of automation 
tests: Web, Mobile, API, DB, IoT and more. Learn more about OxygenHQ:
