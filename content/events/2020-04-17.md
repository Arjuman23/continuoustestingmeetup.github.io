### Self-management in the testing community
[Paul Walker](https://www.theorywhy.co/)

Lack of clarity on who needs to test what, getting in trouble for not 
testing every browser when you had no idea your company was still supporting 
Internet Explorer 8, or taking the heat for all the bugs on the site even 
though you told them not to make it live because of said bugs ... Many of 
the common issues traditionally encountered in the workplace are amplified 
when working remotely. This is no different in the testing community.

Now more than ever, it is of benefit to everyone to work more effectively. 
I'll talk about my experience implementing self-management in a Fortune 
100 company, how to pinpoint and address some of the most common issues, 
and how to work in a way that gives you more autonomy while making the 
entire team and company more productive and efficient.

###### Bio
Paul makes organizational change convenient, he likes to help companies 
improve their employee experience so that everyone has the opportunity 
to be happy at work.
