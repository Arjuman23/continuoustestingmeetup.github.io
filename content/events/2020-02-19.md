### Design for Failure
[Italo Vietro, Head of Technology LykonDX](https://twitter.com/italolelis)

Failure has been neglected for quite some time in our industry, but how 
can we design for failure? And especially, how Go can help us be prepared 
for the unexpected? In recent years, weâ€™ve been talking more and more 
about failure and resiliency. This is something that mission-critical 
systems always had to think of first, but many of our systems 
(until today) neglect the importance of this. In this talk I would 
like to talk about how to design a system for failure, what are the 
pitfalls and gotchas that we have to be prepared in a microservice 
environment? And most importantly, how Go can help us be prepared 
for the unexpected?

How one can use contributions to the community (beyond the usual 
suspects of open source and tech talks) as a compass for personal 
and professional growth.
