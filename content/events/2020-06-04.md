### Hunting Bugs with Puppeteer and AWS Lambda
[Sarah Wachs, Software Developer at Searchmetrics](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sarah-wachs-152665127/)

One of the worst bugs to have is the one that is hard to reproduce but 
has very serious consequences. We were recently faced with one such bug 
after we added a new caching layer to our application.

The quest to reproduce this bug finally ended when we decided to move away 
from manual testing. We moved to a more automated approach using AWS Lambda 
functions and puppeteer to scale up our testing efforts. With our swarm of 
Lambda functions we were finally able to identify the root cause, evaluate 
our fix and create a regression test.

I will share our approach and what we learned on the way.
